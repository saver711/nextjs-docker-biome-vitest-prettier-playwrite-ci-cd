## Table Overview

**Data tables** are one of the most common UI components in web applications. However, most component libraries provide only basic table components without real-world examples that show how to integrate them with pagination, sorting, filtering, and backend data.
This section covers best practices for building reusable, maintainable data tables that work in real applications.

## Key Principles

### Separation of Concerns

The table component should be purely presentational. The table receives data and emits events.

### Composability

Allow replacing parts like headers, cells, and empty states. shadcn's column definition pattern already supports this via custom render functions.

### Type Safety

Use TypeScript generics to type rows and columns. This ensures compile-time safety and better IDE support.

### External Integration

The table component never fetches data. It accepts pre-fetched data and handlers from the parent.

## Examples

<div className="flex flex-col gap-3 mt-6">
  <a href="/docs/components/table/client-data" className="underline text-primary hover:text-primary/80">
    Client-side data table →
  </a>
  <a href="/docs/components/table/server-data" className="underline text-primary hover:text-primary/80">
    Server-side data table →
  </a>
</div>
